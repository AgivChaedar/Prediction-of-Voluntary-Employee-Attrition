# Prediction of Voluntary Employee Attrition

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict voluntary employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The model identifies key factors that influence voluntary turnover by analyzing employee data, helping organizations proactively implement retention strategies. The project employs various data preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and multiple machine learning algorithms to build a robust predictive model.

## Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution and relationship of variables such as salary, work tenure, and employee benefits.
Feature Selection: Key features are selected using Pearson correlation and Chi-square tests to enhance model performance.
Modeling: Development of machine learning models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, combined using a Soft Voting Classifier to improve predictive accuracy.
Performance Evaluation: Using cross-validation, evaluation of model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of employee information from various categories including:

Salary and Benefits
Distance from Work
Position and Work Tenure
Marital Status and Educational Background
The data was processed to remove missing values, handle outliers, and standardize the format.
